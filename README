qtonrails
=========

This is currently an work-in-progress attempt at building a simple framework that would let a developer comfortable with Rails generate a runnable Qt4 project. So far you can generate a simple CRUD Qt Application by installing the qtonrails plugin and using some generators.


installation
============

Easily installed as a Rails plugin:

./script/plugin install git://github.com/theirishpenguin/qtonrails.git


usage
=====
If you'd like a play then you can certainly run through the following steps to understand how qtonrails works. Here goes...

1. You are going to Qt-ify one of your existing Rails models. Ensure that you have at least one record in the database for that model

2. Ensure you are in the top level directory of your Rails project (ie. not in vendor/plugins/qtonrails)

3. If you're a *NIX user then you should be able to simply run ./script/generate qtify YourModelName and straight to step 5

4. Run the following
./script/generate qform YourModelName
./script/generate qpresenters
./script/generate qtablemodel YourModelName
./script/generate qcontroller YourModelName
./script/generate qview YourModelName
./script/generate qmainwindow
./script/generate qmainwindow # NNB: Must do this last step twice!!! Dunno why

5. Require any gems your model layer needs to qtonrails/config/requires_list.rb

6. Finally, navigate to the vendor/plugins/qtonrails/ directory and execute the ./run command

What should happen?
===================
You should get to the list screen for your chosen model, which also acts as a home page. You can do the usual CRUD stuff
- View the record
- Create a new record
- Edit the record data directly in the grid. Or else you can click the edit button, which will bring up your chosen record for editing.
- Delete a record

The idea of this initial release is to show the kind of workflow possible out of the box with qtonrails; and also to help make architectural decisions such as how will we do things like the routing and lots lots more. If you fancy hacking on this project then please fire ahead. I'd be delighted to hear from you if you're interested in this project.


generators
==========
Usage: ./script/generate qcontroller RailsModelName
Description:
    Adds an .rb file containing a QController definition for the RailsModel to the vendor/plugins/qtonrails/app/qcontrollers directory. QControllers are responsible for deciding what data is to be retrieved for the related QView.

Usage: ./script/generate qform RailsModelName
Description:
    Adds a .ui file containing a QForm definition for the RailsModel to the vendor/plugins/qtonrails/app/qdesigns directory. This .ui file can be opened in Qt designer.

Usage: ./script/generate qmainwindow
Description:
    Adds a .ui file containing a Qt::MainWindow definition to the vendor/plugins/qtonrails/app/qdesigns directory. This .ui file can be opened in Qt designer. Additionally it creates a ui_proxy (Ruby presentation of the .ui file) for the Qt::MainWindow along with a qpresenter file. NOTE: There is currently a bug that requires this generator to be run twice - it does not work correctly if only run once.

Usage: ./script/generate presenters
Description:
    Auto-generates presenter files for all qforms in vendor/plugins/qtonrails/app/qdesigns directory. The generated files live in the vendor/plugins/qtonrails/app/presenters directory. You can edit these files to change the presentation logic that controls the qform.

    For each qform, this step also auto-generates a .ui.rb file in the vendor/plugins/qtonrails/app/ui_proxies directory. These .ui.rb files are a Ruby code representation of the Qt Designer .ui files. You should never hand edit these files as they will be overwritten on calling this generator again. Instead change the presenter files.

Usage: ./script/generate qtablemodel RailsModelName
Description:
    Adds a qtablemodel.rb file and a qtablemodel_gen.rb file to for the RailsModel to the vendor/plugins/qtonrails/app/qtablesmodels directory. A tablemodel (Qt::AbstractTableModel) sits between a list of your Rails models (eg. a list of Product objects) and the widget that displays them in your application (eg. a Qt::TableView widget). A tablemodel is just data - it doesn't know that it's based on a Product model. The qtablemodel_gen.rb file is an autogenerated Ruby representation of tablemodel and is not intended to be edited. Rather, edit the plain qtablemodel.rb file if you need to alter the qtablemodel code.

Usage: ./script/generate qtify RailsModelName
Description:
    This is the qtonrails equivalent of ./script/generate scaffold Foo in the traditional Rails sense. It creates the full set of skeleton files under the vendor/plugins/qtonrails/app directory to run a Qt version of your Rails model. After generating, you can run your Qt application form the vendor/plugins/qtonrails directory using the ./run command. Additionally, you can find .ui files under the vendor/plugins/qtonrails/app/qdesigns directory that can be opened and edited in Qt Designer. Also there are editable files under the qcontrollers, qpresenters, qtablemodels (though not the _gen.rb file) and qviews directories. The files in the ui_proxies directory are not intended to be edited.

Usage: ./script/generate qview RailsModelName
Description:
    Adds a .rb file containing a QView definition for the RailsModel to the vendor/plugins/qtonrails/app/qviews directory. The qview decides what screen to display or how to refresh a screen that is already shown. As such it is probably more like a controller in the traditional Rails sense than a View.
