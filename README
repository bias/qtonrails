qtonrails
=========

This is currently a very early attempt at building a simple framework that would let a developer comfortable with Rails generate a runnable Qt4 project. When we say early attempt, we really mean it. So far you can generate a Qt from from a Rails model.


example
=======

Give the a model called Product existing in your app/models directory, you can

./script/generate qform Product

to create vendor/plugins/qtonrails/app/qforms/product_qform.ui

Open the form in Qt Designer to see what's been generated, for example,

designer-qt vendor/plugins/qtonrails/app/qforms/product_qform.ui

Hey presto! You should see a generated form.


installation
============

Easily installed as a Rails plugin:

./script/plugin install git://github.com/theirishpenguin/qtonrails.git
