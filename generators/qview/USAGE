Usage: ./script/generate qview RailsModelName
Description:
    Adds a .rb file containing a QView definition for the RailsModel to the vendor/plugins/qtonrails/app/qviews directory. The qview decides what screen to display or how to refresh a screen that is already shown. As such it is probably more like a controller in the traditional Rails sense than a View.
