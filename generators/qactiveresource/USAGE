Usage: ./script/generate qactiveresource RemoteResourceDefinition

Examples:
./script/generate qactiveresource Order:"http://example.com"[xml,/orders.xml?q=33,id:integer,name:string,description:text]

Description:
    This creates an ActiveResource class under app/models directory of our Rails project and also adds the ActiveResource to vendor/plugins/qtonrails/config/remote_resources.rb.

The RemoteResourceDefinition is a string that defines a remote resource with the syntax

ACTIVE_RESOURCE_NAME:"RESOURCE_SITE_URL"[RESPONSE_FORMAT,/RESOURCE_QUERYSTRING,RESOURCE_ATTRIB_1_NAME:RESOURCE_ATTRIB_1_TYPE,RESOURCE_ATTRIB_2_NAME:RESOURCE_ATTRIB_2_TYPE, ...]

NOTE: RESOURCE_ATTRIB_1 should the the record identifier.

You can specify as many name RESOURCE_ATTRIB name-value pairs as you like. These will determine what fields from the response will be displayed on the UI. The RESPONSE_FORMAT is typically XML or JSON.

An ActiveResource does not need to already exist under your app/models directory. This generator will create one for you. Also, if each remote resource will put an entry into the config/remote_resources.rb file.
