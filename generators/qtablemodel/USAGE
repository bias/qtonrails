Usage: ./script/generate qtablemodel RailsModelName
Description:
    Adds a qtablemodel.rb file and a qtablemodel_gen.rb file to for the RailsModel to the vendor/plugins/qtonrails/app/qtablesmodels directory. A tablemodel (Qt::AbstractTableModel) sits between a list of your Rails models (eg. a list of Product objects) and the widget that displays them in your application (eg. a Qt::TableView widget). A tablemodel is just data - it doesn't know that it's based on a Product model. The qtablemodel_gen.rb file is an autogenerated Ruby representation of tablemodel and is not intended to be edited. Rather, edit the plain qtablemodel.rb file if you need to alter the qtablemodel code.
