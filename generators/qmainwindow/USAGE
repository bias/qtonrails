Usage: ./script/generate qmainwindow [nav_items:NavItem1,NavItem2,...] [table_selection:row|cell]
Description:
    Adds a .ui file containing a Qt::MainWindow definition to the vendor/plugins/qtonrails/app/qdesigns directory. This .ui file can be opened in Qt designer. Additionally it creates a ui_proxy (Ruby presentation of the .ui file) for the Qt::MainWindow along with a qpresenter file. NOTE: There is currently a bug that requires this generator to be run twice - it does not work correctly if only run once. An optional argument that can be passed is nav_items - which will build a navigation link for each NavItem specified. Typically, each NavItem is a Rails controller name. If multiple NavItems are specified then they must be separated by a comma and contain no spaces. Though Rails controller names are CapitalCased (eg. FruitOrders), the navigation link will appear in Title Case (eg. Fruit Orders) on the UI. Finally, by setting table_selection, you can specify whether a click within the table selects the entire row or just the cell clicked on; row selection is the default.
